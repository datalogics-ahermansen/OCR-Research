Basic OCR information

OCR - Optical Character Recognition
OCR is a technology which allows a user to provide an image of text (scan/screenshot/photo) and convert it into actual editable/searchable text. 

There are three basic principles behind OCR - integrity, purposefulness, and adaptability (IPA).

OCR examines the structure of a document - dividing it into elements such as blocks of text, tables, and images. It further breaks these down into lines, then words, and finally characters. The characters are compared to predetermined patterns in attempt to distinguish each character. In some methods, once the individual characters are found, the OCR will run algorithms to hypothesize the most probable combinations of letters/words to give the most accurate representation of the scanned data. This is especially useful in text where words are not seperated (glyphs/cursive/etc...). 

Some of the biggest issues OCR software runs into is poor scan quality.  This can be remedied (to some extent) by utilizing an array of pre-proccessing tools.  Common pre-processing methods incluce de-skewing, binizarization, de-noising, de-speckling, and scaling.
